TBH i would love to ask everyone how are they but like no (even tho it's driving me crazy...)\r\nfuck me and my fucked up skibidy life i guess\r\non the other note my s key is dying actively and my right mouse button too... S just sometimes doesn't register and my right click is sometime unpress when hold... annoying i hope i can clean the contacts and it'll be ok cuz i really dont wanna soder... "
