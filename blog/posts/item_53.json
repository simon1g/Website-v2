One side I wanna come and say that I'm sorry what my wrongdoings but at the same the I feel like there's no point... FUCKKKK I have no idea. I have no clue. Fuck simon you really really fall off, tbh I feel so shit cuz it was cuz of me I cause it. I went through hell in life. From uncle saying he will murder us in our sleep to dad almost killing himself yet I haven't feel this bad. I tried and helped everyone beside my mom and I haven't felt this bad, I felt drained and exhausted it was a wild, but this time I am the cause and that's prolly why I feel so funking bad, after trying everything to help everyone now I only managed to hurt... it funking sucks like it hadn't before "
