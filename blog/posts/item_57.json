OH also done 15km on bike before i met buda so... i wanted to get started with some javascript frame work but i always have time tomorrow... i'm lost intrest in bluesky ngl it was fun but it wasn't for me i guess, now i just wanna know how's everyone i met there doing... but it's prolly safe to assume they're happy. the idea of asking even iva if i can come back is putting me in so much stress... THE IDEA ITSELF FUCKKK, now simon imagine actually going and trying fuck... it's late so im prolly gonna head to bed soon and watch so manlybadasshero my goat "
